  <p1>Hey all, Joe here. I just want to say that this is the start of something incredible, i can feel it.</p1>
  <p1>Hopefully you feel the same way too. This is my second semester at Lehman, I hope to level up in CSS,</p1> 
  <p1>JavaScript and HTML. It won't be an easy one, I don't expect it to(seriously, it took me three days to create this abomination you're seeing right now), because the important achievments are difficult to attain,</p1>
  <p1>but i'm determined to do what is required of me. Hope to learn more with you guys, big shout outs to my crew in group 6. Below is a table of some of the languages and frameworks i've worked on soo far, and a few more i'd love to learn. ‚úåüèª</p1>
